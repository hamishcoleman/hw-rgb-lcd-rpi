This design is to adapt a "raw" or "dotclock" LCD to the Raspberry-Pi
expansion pinout, and allow it to be connected directly to the GPU
(not via SPI)

TODO:
- clarify the OSHW licence
- Add more documentation
- The lq043t1dg03 footprint needs adjusting - the large mechanical stay
  pads are in the wrong places
- All the custom footprints need a pin 1 indicator
